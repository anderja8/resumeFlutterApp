# resumeFlutterApp

A new Flutter project exploring simple tab based navigation, widget hierarchies, page layouts, and app integration with url_launcher.

This app is a simple resume app with three tabs. One tab displays a business card, one displays a resume, and one displays a "magic 8-ball" style guesser. It's good for relieving stress when waiting to hear back from interviews.
